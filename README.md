# MvvmKit
By Kobi Hari

## A strongly opinionated Mvvm framework and Toolkit

## This framework believes in:
* Unidirectional Binding
* View Model First
* Task based Asynchronous model
* Design time data and "Blendability"
* Region Based Navigation
* "Lazy" loading of hidden view models
* IoC and Dependency Injection

## The framework provides the base classes for your MVVM application, along with several utilities such as:
* Better usage of the IDisposable Pattern
* Complementary classes for TPL
* A set of Delegate classes that rely on Weak References so they allow the target to be garbage collected
* A set of WPF controls that uspport Unidirectional Data Binding
* And many more extensions and helpers
