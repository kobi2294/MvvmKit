# MvvmKit
By Kobi Hari (2019)

## A strongly opinionated Mvvm framework and Toolkit

## This repository is actually 2 products: 
* A general purpose toolkit containing several useful .net packages
* A strongly opinionated MVVM framework that is the sum of my experience develping enterprise WPF Applications

## This framework believes in:
* Unidirectional Binding
* View Model First
* Task based Asynchronous model
* Design time data and "Blendability"
* Region Based Navigation
* "Lazy" loading of hidden view models
* IoC and Dependency Injection

## The framework provides the base classes for your MVVM application, along with several utilities such as:
* Better usage of the IDisposable Pattern
* Complementary classes for TPL
* A set of Delegate classes that rely on Weak References so they allow the target to be garbage collected
* A set of WPF controls that uspport Unidirectional Data Binding
* And many more extensions and helpers
